# 📈 Forecasting Picking Cases Project

Welcome to the Forecasting Picking Cases Project! This project is designed to predict the number of picking cases for future dates using historical data.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project consists of three main Python scripts:

*   **data_preparation.py:** Prepares the data for modeling by loading, cleaning, and feature engineering.
*   **model_training.py:** Trains a Random Forest Regressor model using the prepared data.
*   **forecasting.py:** Uses the trained model to forecast the picking cases for the next 10 working days.

## 🔨 Installation and Usage

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Ensure you have Python and all required libraries installed.
3.  Run the `data_preparation.py` script to prepare your dataset.
4.  Execute the `model_training.py` to train the model with your data.
5.  Finally, use the `forecasting.py` script to predict the picking cases for future dates.
